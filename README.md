# Web-Scraping

We would like to find all CSUF Faculty and Administration from 
CSUF 2020-2021 University Catalog at
   https://catalog.fullerton.edu/content.php?catoid=61&navoid=7316
using web scraping with Python. 

For each faculty or staff, we want to get the following information:

- Name: Faculty or Staff name

- Year: the year of this faculty or staff joining CSUF
    
- Position: Position of this faculty or staff at CSUF
    
- Education: Degrees of this faculty or staff
